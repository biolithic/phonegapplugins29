phonegapplugins29
=================

Updated Android PhoneGap Plugins for version 2.9.  The originals are at https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins

These plugins come from the source, but do not work correctly in PhoneGap 2.7 - 2.9 (3.x+ use the new system).
It's explained why here (http://simonmacdonald.blogspot.com/2013/06/why-dont-my-plugins-work-in-phonegap.html), 
and as I use PhoneGap plugins for 2.9 (most stable version 7/13), I will post my converted-to-2.9 plugins here.
I will post the Java files only as the other files of the plugins have not changed.
